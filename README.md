# Machine Learning Linear Regression with SKLearn 

* We are going to write a model to predict area of a circle given it radius
* We will also plot a simple line graph for the same
* To start with, we will train our model with radius range as 1 to 14
* The we will predict area for radius 7

* See sample graph
