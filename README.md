# Machine Learning Linear Regression with SKLearn 

* We are going to write a model to predict area of a circle given it radius
* We will also plot a simple line graph for the same
* To start with, we will train our model with radius range of 1 to 14
* The we will predict area for radius 7
* Sample output 
* LinearRegression: Circle r =  47  A =  [9476.62642754]  CA =  6939.7782
* SVM: Circle r =  47  A =  [6939]  CA =  6939.7782


* See sample graph
